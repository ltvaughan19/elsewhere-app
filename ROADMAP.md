- [x] `packages/source-engine` badge helpers
- [x] Env templates
- [ ] Supabase project + migrations

### Pages
- [x] `/` landing (globe + dashboard preview + journey)

## Phase 2 — App Shell (Weeks 4–6)

- [ ] Supabase Auth (email magic link or password)
- [ ] `/app/onboarding` — readiness quiz
- [ ] `/app/dashboard` — readiness score, next step, best fit
- [ ] `/app/my-plan` — 30-day action plan
- [ ] `/app/passport`, `/app/budget` — persisted state
- [ ] `/app/saved`, `/app/settings`
- [ ] Feature gates by plan tier (metadata only)

**Exit criteria:** User can sign up, complete quiz, see dashboard, save countries, persist budget + passport checklist.

---

## Phase 3 — Source Engine & Admin (Weeks 7–9)

- [ ] `packages/source-engine`
- [ ] Full `source_claims` CRUD in admin
- [ ] Official URL, last verified, confidence UI on country/visa pages
- [ ] User “report outdated info” flow
- [ ] Admin report queue
- [ ] `source_watchlist` + placeholder snapshot job structure

**Exit criteria:** No hard-coded legal claims without source metadata; admin can verify and publish claims.

---

## Phase 4 — Partner & Sponsor Readiness (Weeks 10–11)

- [ ] Partner application form → `partner_applications`
- [ ] Admin partner approval queue
- [ ] Partner statuses + demo cards
- [ ] `sponsored_placements` schema + admin UI
- [ ] Sponsored/affiliate disclosure components
- [ ] Lead request intake + waitlists

**Exit criteria:** Partner pipeline works end-to-end with demo data; no fake verified partners.

---

## Phase 5 — Community & Reviews (Weeks 12–13)

- [ ] Cohorts + waitlist join
- [ ] Review submission + moderation queue
- [ ] Report/block user (basic)
- [ ] Field reports on countries/cities

**Exit criteria:** Reviews require moderation; no unsafe stranger matching.

---

## Phase 6 — Mobile (Weeks 14–16)

- [ ] `apps/mobile` Expo scaffold
- [ ] Shared tokens, types, validation, scoring
- [ ] Dashboard, plan, checklist, budget, saved, visa screens
- [ ] EAS config (build not required for MVP exit)

**Exit criteria:** Core flows work on iOS/Android simulator.

---

## Phase 7 — QA & Deployment (Weeks 17–18)

- [ ] Playwright: landing CTA, signup, onboarding, budget
- [ ] Vitest: scoring + budget calculators
- [ ] axe accessibility pass
- [ ] Lighthouse CI
- [ ] Security review (`gstack-cso`)

- [ ] Production deploy + admin bootstrap

**Exit criteria:** CI green; production URL live; README runbook complete.
